I will not help you change the 'source' file

The 'source' file needs to be parented to the main module

The 'Configuration' folders allows you to modify the sound and animation that occurs.
Animation - Change the value to an uploaded animation asset's id. Ensure you or the group owns the asset, or that the animation is compatible with R6/R15.
Sound - Change the value to an uploaded audio track's id. Ensure that either your or your group owns it if the audio is not public.
